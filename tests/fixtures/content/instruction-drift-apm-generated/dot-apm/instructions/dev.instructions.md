# Development guide

## Pre-push checklist

Run the full test suite with `make test` before every push and fix any
failure you find rather than assuming it is pre-existing. Check
formatting with `make lint` and regenerate every generated file with
`make update` after a version bump. Finally, clone the downstream
consumer repository and confirm the linter exits zero against it before
you open the pull request and request a review from the module owner.
